# SpaceInvader
For the second project, we decided to build to the game Space Invader, the 2-dimensional arcade game. The users can either win the game by taking all of the enemies down or lose the game by making its stamina 0. 

# TrackA
# Purpose: 
The purpose of checkpoint 2 Track A was to familiarize the openGL library functions. We drew a upside-down triangle in the navy background.

# How to run it:
1. Type "make" in the terminal
2. Type "DISPLAY=:0 ./main" in the terminal

# TrackB
# Purpose:
The purpose of checkpoint 2 Track B is to design an object that depends on user iputs. There are three possible user inputs that controls an object: left arrow key input, right arrow key input, and space bar input. Left arrow key and right arrow key inputs move an object horizontally on x-axis. An object does not move along y-axis. The space bar input creates a bullet in front of an object. 

# How to run it:
1. Type "make" in the terminal
2. Type "DISPLAY=:0 ./space" in the terminal

# TrackC
# Purpose:
The purpose of checkpoint 2 Track C is to design non-player objects that does not directly depend on user inputs. Each bullet created from space bar inputs becomes NPCs that can move by itself. It moves toward the top of the screen, only ascending its y-axis location. 

# How to run it:
Follow the "#How to run it" from checkpoint 2 Track B.
